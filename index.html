              Upon discovering SheCodes online, I have been able to expand my
              knowledge base in web development through immersive learning
              experiences centered around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a
              testament to my acquired skills, I successfully designed and
              developed a yogurt webpage, marking a significant milestone in my
              journey as a web developer. I was able to create a visually
              appealing and functional webpage that highlights my technical
              abilities in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provided an
              opportunity to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, as well
              as to test my problem-solving skills in overcoming coding
              challenges. This yogurt webpage project serves as a testament to
              my progress and passion for the craft, as well as a springboard
              for future web development projects.

              I developed a weather application using Vanilla JavaScript, which
              I built during the SheCodes Plus workshop - an advanced 8-week
              program focused on honing skills in JavaScript coding. In addition
              to my prior knowledge, I have gained a comprehensive understanding
              of Bootstrap, API integration, real-life development workflow,
              hosting, and advanced JavaScript concepts, which were all
              leveraged in the creation of this project. With the combination of
              these skills, I was able to develop a robust and fully-functional
              weather app.

              Following my successful completion of the introductory workshop on
              basic HTML, I was inspired to utilize my newfound skills and
              create a website dedicated to a course that holds a significant
              meaning to me. Drawing upon the knowledge and techniques acquired
              during the workshop, I successfully developed a website that not
              only effectively showcases the course's value but also highlights
              my proficiency in HTML coding. By leveraging my understanding of
              HTML tags, elements, and structure, I was able to design and
              develop a website that captures the essence of the course and
              effectively conveys its importance. The website also incorporates
              user-friendly features and responsive design principles, which
              ensure seamless navigation and optimal viewing experience across
              multiple devices.Overall, this project was an excellent
              opportunity for me to put my HTML skills to the test and create a
              meaningful website that showcases my technical abilities and
              creative prowess.
